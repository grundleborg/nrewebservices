        generated_at (datetime): the time at which the board was generated on the LDBWS server.

        location_name (str): the name of the location the board is for.

        crs (str): the CRS code of the location the board is for.

        filter_location_name (str): if a filter was provided in the request, the name of the
            location at which the board services were filtered.

        filter_crs (str): if a filter was provided in the request, the CRS code of the location at
            which the board services were filtered.

        filter_type (str): if a filter was provided in the request, this can contain either "from",

            en-route. This attribute is only populated for boards where arrivals are included.

            present where it is available from station CIS systems and where `platforms_available`
            is set to True on the parent board.

        operator_code (str): the two-letter code identifying the Train Operating Company that
            operates this service. Please see the Open Rail Data Wiki `Toc Codes Page 
            <http://nrodwiki.rockshore.net/index.php/TOC_Codes>`_ for the full list.

        circular_route (boolean): when True, this service is operating on a circular route and will
            call at this station again later on its journey. This should be clearly communicated in
            user interfaces to ensure users can effectively identify the right train to take from
            the different options that exist in this case.

        cancelled (boolean): when True, indicates that this service has been cancelled at this
            location.

        filter_location_cancelled (boolean): when True, indicates that the service has had its
            stop at the requested filter location cancelled and now will not stop there.

        service_type (str): the type of transport this service consists of. Can be *train*, *bus* or
            *ferry*.
        
        length (str): the train length (in number of units). If this is set to 0 then the length
            of the train is unknown.

        detach_front (boolean): if True then the service detaches units from the front at this
            location.

        reverse_formation (boolean): if True then the service is operating in reverse formation
            (i.e. the order of the train carriages is the reverse of what it normally is).

        cancel_reason (str): if this service is canelled, the reason for this cancellation.

        delay_reason (str): if this service is delayed, the reason for this delay.

        service_id (str): the unique identifier of this service relative to the station of the board
            at which this service exists. This ID can be used to lookup the service details with
            `get_service_details`. However, this ID is not useful for using with any other API,
            and will expire and stop working within a few hours of the service being deactivated.

        adhoc_alerts (str): a list of adhoc alerts to show for this service at this location.
        
        rsid (str): the Retail Service ID of the service, if known by the Darwin system.

        origin (str): the origin (or origins) of this service as a single string which is suitable
            for display directly to users.

        destination (str): the destination (or destinations) of this service as a single string
